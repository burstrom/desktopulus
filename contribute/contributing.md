## <a name="intro"></a> Introduction
This project started out as a university project, so the first milestones/issues might look a bit weird since we used them to monitor our work during the project-time.

We thank you for reading these guidelines and that you follow them when supporting this project. If there are any questions or you encounter problems. Just talk to us or send an issue about it. (if you can't solve it by yourself)

Let's get coding and have fun!

## <a name="code"></a> Coding conventions

We aim to have a clean code with smart variable-naming. 

Try to comment your function what it is supposed to do and how it does it (just briefly). 

We do not want to have 50% of all the files filled with comments for each function, but if you have a function that isn't self-explanatory then comment. 

It's better to have more than less comments in the code, just don't write an essay.

## <a name="submit"></a> Submitting/committing your code

When committing your code, please use the format on the first short line

```
[TYPE] shortdesc of what have been done 

Longer description (if needed), but in most cases, it is not needed

```

So in example, if you have fixed an issue:

```
[FIX]:#14 Fixed the contrib file. 

Still needs some more work to be done to it, but it's on it's way.

```
