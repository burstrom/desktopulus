# NOTICE:

During the period of Oktober 2014 - January 2015, we will not accept any pull-messages since this project is our work in an actual university course.
When we are in the last week of this project, files like this will be deleted and we will do our best to make sure everyone can help out with this project.

But for now, please bear with us and hold on to your horses!

Regards
- Burstrom, Zakjut, Kandarian & Olleboll
